# NSO SITH

#### (Non-Skating Official Software for Information Tracking Help)

This project will be a digital alternative to the IGRF currently used in flat-track derby. Currently I am looking towards leveraging iOS and Android backed on a CouchbaseDB.

Here are my current design goals:
 
* Interface based on current NSO paperwork.
* Locational isolation, where each NSO could use the application even if no one else is.
* Translate the data into a PDF version of the IGRF form.
* Minimal development work.
